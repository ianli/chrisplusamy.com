## As jiffy as a skiff

2010 November 13

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiff):

The term skiff is a type of small boat.

The word is related to ship and has a complicated etymology: "skiff" comes from the Middle English _skif_, which derives from the Old French _esquif_, which in turn derives from the Old Italian _schifo_, which is itself of Germanic origin (German _Schiff_). "Ship" comes from the Old English "scip", which has the same Germanic predecessor.
